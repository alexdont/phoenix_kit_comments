  Comment bodies are rendered with `unsafe: true` so that markdown-adjacent
  HTML works, which makes whatever runs afterwards the security boundary.

  It used to be a handful of regexes over the rendered string. A blocklist
  over HTML loses, and this one lost in two ways that a reader of the code
  would not spot: the `<script>` pattern required a CLOSING tag, and the
  `javascript:` patterns required the attribute value to be QUOTED. Both
  payloads below executed for every reader of a thread, and again in the
  admin moderation list, which renders the same component.

  These run against the real renderer, not a stub.
