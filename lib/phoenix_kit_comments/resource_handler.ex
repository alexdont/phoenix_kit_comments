defmodule PhoenixKitComments.ResourceHandler do
  @moduledoc """
  The contract a host module implements to hook into comments.

  Register one per `resource_type`:

      config :phoenix_kit, :comment_resource_handlers, %{
        "post" => MyApp.Posts
      }

  Every callback is optional — implement only the events you care about — so
  a handler is free to be a two-line module that reacts to one thing.

  ## Why adopt the behaviour

  Dispatch is by `function_exported?/3`, and it always will be: a handler is
  named in host config, may live in another application, and may legitimately
  implement none of these. That is a good property, and it has one bad
  consequence — a callback this package never finds is indistinguishable from
  one you chose not to write. Misname `on_comment_create` (no `d`), take two
  arguments instead of three, and nothing happens: no error, no warning, no
  notification, and nothing to grep for. The host discovers it when someone
  reports that notifications stopped.

  `@behaviour PhoenixKitComments.ResourceHandler` turns that into a compile
  warning at the point of the mistake. It is not required and changes nothing
  at runtime; it only makes the failure loud. Handlers registered today keep
  working untouched.

      defmodule MyApp.Posts do
        @behaviour PhoenixKitComments.ResourceHandler

        @impl true
        def on_comment_created(_type, post_uuid, comment) do
          MyApp.Posts.notify_author(post_uuid, comment)
        end
      end

  ## What is passed

  The event callbacks all receive the `resource_type` and `resource_uuid` the
  comment was filed against, so one handler can serve several types.

  Reaction callbacks take a map rather than the comment alone because the
  comment row carries its *author*, not the person reacting — `:liker_uuid`
  is the only place that appears.

  ## Paths are RAW

  `resolve_comment_resources/1` returns `path` WITHOUT the PhoenixKit url
  prefix — the renderer applies `Routes.path/1` once. A handler that
  pre-prefixes gets a doubled prefix.

  ## What is NOT decided here

  Reaction callbacks fire only when the state actually changed
  (`{:ok, :liked}`), never on an `:already_liked` no-op. Self-action skipping
  — not notifying someone who liked their own comment — is left to the
  handler, which is the only party that knows whether that matters.

  A callback that raises is caught and logged; it cannot fail the comment
  that triggered it.
