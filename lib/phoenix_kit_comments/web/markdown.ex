  Shared markdown rendering for comment content.

  Comments are authored as markdown in the Leaf composer (which renders with
  MDEx); rendering with the same engine and `render` options on display keeps
  the two consistent. Output is sanitised by MDEx's allow-list for XSS
  protection. Used by both the public comments component and the admin
  moderation page so bold/italics/lists/etc. show formatted instead of raw.

  Renders a comment's markdown content to sanitized HTML inside a `pk-comment-md`
  block. The `.pk-comment-md` class (styled by `comment_markdown_styles/1`)
  restores list/block spacing without depending on the `@tailwindcss/typography`
  (`prose`) plugin being present in the host — render `comment_markdown_styles`
  once on any page that uses this.

  Named `comment_markdown` (not `markdown`) to avoid clashing with core's
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Components.Core.Markdown.markdown/1`, which is imported wherever
  `use PhoenixKitWeb` is in play.

  Renders markdown to sanitised HTML (or escaped text on a parse error). Blank
  input returns an empty string.

  ## Why `sanitize:` and not a regex pass afterwards

  `unsafe: true` is what lets a comment contain real markdown-adjacent HTML,
  and it disables MDEx's own escaping — so everything downstream of it is the
  security boundary. That used to be a handful of regexes over the rendered
  string, which is a blocklist, and a blocklist over HTML loses:

    * `&lt;script&gt;alert(1)` with NO closing tag survived — the pattern required
      a matching `&lt;/script&gt;`.
    * `&lt;a href=javascript:alert(1)&gt;` survived — the pattern required the value
      to be quoted.

  Both were verified against the real renderer, and both execute for every
  reader of a thread and again in the admin moderation list, which renders the
  same component. MDEx's `:sanitize` is ammonia, an allow-list: unknown tags
  and every attribute outside the allowed set are dropped rather than matched
  against, and it rewrites `rel` on links for free. There is no opt-out.
